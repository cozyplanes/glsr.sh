Inspiration
===========

When I was at elementary school, nearly 30-something years ago, there was a
classmate, who loved to spend time to cut paper into long narrow strips,
gluing end to end into a long piece of paper, and drawing on it.

Once done drawing, rolling up into a paper roll, he would present the Paper
Roll of Adventure to you with a starting path, asking you to put you finger on
the line, and the journey starts.

Slowly unrolling, usually, you hit a split pretty quick, and you will have to
choose Left or Right, the paths split and merge, but sometimes you hit dead
ends, and that's The End.  But more often, you encounter stuff or monsters or
portals with whatever the stories he would make up.

I remember the excitement on his face, since it took a lot of time to
prepare, I pretended to be excited for the latest adventure is about to unfold,
but actually thinking 'not a roll, again!'.  While playing it, all I was
thinking, 'Please let me get that treasure chest, please!  Don't hit dead ends,
definitely not the monsters.'  Why?  Because, restart!  The chest was always
the proper ending.

Frankly, I could never understand why he would spend so much time to work on
this game.

This script isn't this game, but it is inspired by it.
